1. All the users should have an option of sending the push.
2. Once a push is sent, the following model needs to work: 
                            - The push reaches a specified set of people X or is stored in a location Y
                            - X then analyzes the push / accesses Y
                            - If X approves the push, X has a "method" to send the push
                            - The push then reaches all the users
3. The users should have an option to turn the push on /off. Also the user should be able to decide which push the user wants to see. 
   So, push channels/categories need to be made.
